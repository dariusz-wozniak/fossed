## Introduction

[NBomber](https://github.com/PragmaticFlow/NBomber) is a distributed load-testing framework for .NET. It is designed to test any system regardless of the protocol (HTTP/WebSockets/AMQP) or a semantic model (Pull/Push). It allows developers to write distributed load test scenarios entirely using plain C# or F#.

NBomber aims to provide a lightweight framework for writing load tests to simulate various production workloads and validate proof-of-concept projects.

## Licensing

NBomber shifted its licensing model starting with version 5.

*   **NBomber v5+:** Requires a commercial license for organizational use. Personal use remains free. It is distributed via NuGet under the [NBomber License Agreement v2.0](https://nbomber.com/assets/NBOMBER-LICENSE-AGREEMENT-2.0.pdf). This version is closed-source.
*   **NBomber v4:** Remains under the Apache 2.0 license, free for all uses. The source code available on GitHub corresponds to this version.

  The distinction between the NuGet package license (v5+) and the GitHub source code license (v4/Apache 2.0) was clarified in a [GitHub issue discussion](https://github.com/PragmaticFlow/NBomber/issues/596).

**Key points from the commercial license agreement (v2.0):**

*   Grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable license for the subscription period for the customer's internal operations.
*   Prohibits distributing license keys, selling/sub-licensing/renting/leasing the software, distributing it standalone or as part of another product, removing proprietary notices, and reverse-engineering.
*   The software might include third-party open-source components provided "as is".
*   NBomber LLC is not liable for damages from incorrect software usage.
