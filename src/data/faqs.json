  "question": "Library X has gone commercial. What are my options?",
  "answerPreview": "Don't panic! ðŸ˜Ž First, review the pricing and consider paying if you value the library and plan to continue using it. Often, you can stick with the last free version by pinning its version. If the license permits, forking the library for personal maintenance is another option. Finally, explore open-source alternatives."

  "question": "Why is there negative sentiment towards some libraries that have become commercial?",
  "answerPreview": "Negative sentiment towards commercializing libraries arises mainly from how it's done. Moq's secret email collection and network calls via SponsorLink caused backlash. FluentAssertions' abrupt, costly license change also drew criticism, including questions about past contributions. Key issues are: lack of transparency, sudden changes, questionable privacy (Moq), and perceived disrespect. Positive examples like MassTransit's clear versioning and future plans, ImageSharp's fair dual-licensing, and Jimmy Bogard's (MediatR, AutoMapper) transparent, non-punitive approach show that clear communication, grandfathering, and community respect lead to better reception. The process of commercialization must be handled carefully to avoid negative reactions."
